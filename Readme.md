# Project Title

# <span style="font-size:larger;">Pyramid</span>

## Abstract
The inherent traceability of blockchain technology raises privacy concerns, particularly in contexts such as private pyramid schemes where maintaining the anonymity of relationships is paramount. In response, this paper presents a protocol leveraging blind signature techniques to protect these relationships while upholding transaction transparency and blockchain integrity. We delve into the unique challenges posed by private pyramid schemes, where funds can flow between members and their referrers without revealing a relationship. Our protocol addresses this by anonymizing the referral process, allowing for secure transactions without compromising participant privacy. Through rigorous analysis and implementation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating the risks associated with traceability in decentralized systems, offering a promising solution for enhancing privacy while maintaining transparency in blockchain-based applications.
